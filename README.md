## Sorting algorithms 

- Bubble Sort - While not efficient for large datasets, it's often introduced for educational purposes.
- Selection Sort - Similarly, it's simple but not suitable for large datasets.
- Insertion Sort - Effective for small datasets or nearly sorted arrays.
- Merge Sort - Highly efficient and stable, suitable for large datasets.
- Quick Sort - Known for its performance and commonly used in practical applications.
- Heap Sort - Efficient for large datasets, offering O(n log n) complexity.
- Radix Sort - Non-comparative, good for fixed-length integer sorting.
- Bucket Sort - Useful in specific scenarios where the data is uniformly distributed.
- Counting Sort - Efficient for sorting small integers or non-comparative sorting scenarios.
- Shell Sort - An improvement on insertion sort, better for medium-sized arrays.
  
## Searching algorithms 

- **Linear Search**: For sequentially searching through lists.
- **Binary Search**: For efficient searching in sorted arrays.
- **Jump Search**: Combines linear and binary search methods for sorted arrays.
- **Interpolation Search**: Improves on binary search by estimating the position of the target.
- **Exponential Search**: Finds ranges rapidly in unbounded arrays, then applies binary search.
- **Fibonacci Search**: Uses Fibonacci numbers to search in sorted arrays.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Traverses trees or graphs deeply before backtracking.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores neighbors at the current depth before moving deeper.
- **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)**: Searches for the least cost path in weighted graphs.
