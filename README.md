Bubble Sort - While not efficient for large datasets, it's often introduced for educational purposes.
Selection Sort - Similarly, it's simple but not suitable for large datasets.
Insertion Sort - Effective for small datasets or nearly sorted arrays.
Merge Sort - Highly efficient and stable, suitable for large datasets.
Quick Sort - Known for its performance and commonly used in practical applications.
Heap Sort - Efficient for large datasets, offering O(n log n) complexity.
Radix Sort - Non-comparative, good for fixed-length integer sorting.
Bucket Sort - Useful in specific scenarios where the data is uniformly distributed.
Counting Sort - Efficient for sorting small integers or non-comparative sorting scenarios.
Shell Sort - An improvement on insertion sort, better for medium-sized arrays.
Timsort - A hybrid sorting algorithm derived from merge sort and insertion sort, used in Python’s sorted() and Java’s Arrays.sort().
IntroSort - A hybrid sort used in the C++ Standard Library's sort function, combining quicksort, heapsort, and insertion sort.
